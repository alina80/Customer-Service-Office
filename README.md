# Customer-Service-Office
  The aim of the workshop is to create a simple chat with the Customer Service Office. It will implement functionalities described below:

        # the application has two roles: support and customer,     
        # logging into the application,     
        # the customer can create a new thread (conversation) with the Customer Service Office,     
        # on the support side, there is a system of assigning threads to each other,     
        # in a given thread, the client can exchange messages with support (they will not be exchanged live).
